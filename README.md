# PasswordVault
Uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to safely store website login information locally.

## Build and Miscellaneous
Visual Studio will probably yell at you about needing a certain .NET installation. The encrypted file should be hanging out with the executable.

## Plans
I have quite a few plans for QoL features and standard implementations. 
Such as:
   - ~~Cryptographically secure password generation~~
   - ~~User settings pertaining to application use and behaviors~~
   - ~~Fun settings like customizeable window colors~~
   - Form settings like auto-hide and keep-on-top
   - Extra salting of the factory
